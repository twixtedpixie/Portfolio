                    Greetings and salutations, here before you is a webpage
                    that I have been required to make for class where I must
                    showcase my artistic skill via website. This quite possibly
                    may involve asking my mother to take pictures of the art of
                    mine she has hung up at her desk at work, this may have me
                    making more art, this may even have me doing things. Which things,
                    I know not, but things nonetheless. I like things.
                    Things have you doing stuff.
                    
                </p>
